# Base theme class - disable-posts

This extension configures wordpress to hide the administrative
interface for posts from the dashboard (using wordpress as a website
editor - does not need posts - but instead uses structured objects
and pages only.)

## Note:

This plugin in is an extension plugin to Base Theme Class, and so
requires that to be installed.
